🐍 Debugging Python Code: Assignment Guide
Debugging is an essential skill for every programmer. This guide explores common errors, debugging techniques, exception handling, multithreading issues, performance optimizations, and more.

📌 Error Classification
Errors in Python can be categorized into three types:

🔴 Syntax Errors → Issues with the structure of the code.
🟠 Runtime Errors → Errors that occur during execution (e.g., division by zero).
🟢 Logical Errors → Code runs but produces incorrect results.
✅ Fix:
Ensure correct syntax and structure.
Implement proper error handling to avoid runtime issues.
Test logic with sample inputs to detect incorrect outputs.
🛠 Debugging Complex Functions
Debugging functions involves handling incorrect inputs and ensuring correct logic flow.

✅ Fix:
Validate inputs before processing.
Handle exceptions properly to prevent crashes.
Use logging to track errors and identify faulty values.
🎲 Advanced Debugging Challenge: Handling Unreliable Functions
When dealing with unpredictable functions, exception handling ensures stability.

✅ Fix:
Use try-except blocks to catch potential errors.
Implement fallback values when the function fails.
Log failures to analyze patterns in unreliable behavior.
🎯 Writing Debug-Friendly Code
Refactoring improves readability and maintainability.

✅ Fix:
Use meaningful variable names.
Add comments to explain complex logic.
Follow consistent coding standards for better debugging.
🦆 Rubber Duck Debugging
Explaining your code out loud can help identify issues.

✅ Fix:
Walk through the code step by step.
Ask yourself what each line does.
Identify inconsistencies or logic errors while explaining.
🔄 Advanced Challenge: Debugging Multi-Threaded Programs
Multithreading can cause race conditions when accessing shared resources.

✅ Fix:
Use synchronization techniques like locks.
Avoid modifying shared variables without protection.
Debug using logging and controlled test cases.
🛑 Debugging with Breakpoints
Using breakpoints in an IDE helps inspect variable states.

✅ Fix:
Pause execution at critical points to inspect values.
Step through code execution line by line.
Use debugging tools like pdb to analyze issues interactively.
🚀 Memory Optimization and Performance Debugging
Improving memory efficiency helps optimize performance.

✅ Fix:
Use generators to avoid excessive memory usage.
Optimize loops and data structures for efficiency.
Monitor performance bottlenecks with profiling tools.
🔍 Debugging None Returns
Ensuring functions return correct values is crucial.

✅ Fix:
Check if the function is missing a return statement.
Ensure return conditions cover all possible cases.
Validate function outputs with test cases.
🔕 Handling Silent Failures
Errors should not be ignored without proper logging.

✅ Fix:
Always log errors instead of silently passing them.
Use meaningful error messages for better debugging.
Implement structured logging for easier analysis.

🎯 Conclusion
✅ Error classification and debugging techniques.
✅ Handling exceptions and writing debug-friendly code.
✅ Fixing race conditions in multithreading.
✅ Debugging with breakpoints and optimizing memory usage.
✅ Preventing silent failures and ensuring correct return values.
