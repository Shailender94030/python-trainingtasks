## Error Classification

Errors in Python can be categorized into three types:

- *Syntax Errors*: Issues with the structure of the code.
- *Runtime Errors*: Errors that occur during execution, such as division by zero.
- *Logical Errors*: The code runs but produces incorrect results.

### Fixes:
✅ Ensure correct syntax and structure.<br>
✅ Implement proper error handling.<br>
✅ Test logic with sample inputs to detect incorrect outputs.<br>

---

## Debugging Complex Functions

Debugging functions involves handling incorrect inputs and ensuring the correct logic flow.

### Fixes:
✔ Validate inputs before processing.<br>
✔ Handle exceptions properly to prevent crashes.<br>
✔ Use logging to track errors and identify faulty values.<br>

---

## Handling Unreliable Functions

When dealing with unpredictable functions, exception handling ensures stability.

### Fixes:
🔹 Use try-except blocks to catch potential errors.<br>
🔹 Implement fallback values when the function fails.<br>
🔹 Log failures to analyze patterns in unreliable behavior.<br>

## Writing Debug-Friendly Code

Refactoring improves readability and maintainability.

### Fixes:
🖊 Use meaningful variable names.<br>
🖊 Add comments to explain complex logic.<br>
🖊 Follow consistent coding standards for better debugging.<br>

---

## Rubber Duck Debugging

Explaining your code out loud can help identify issues.

### Steps:
🔎 Walk through the code step by step.<br>
🔎 Ask yourself what each line does.<br>
🔎 Identify inconsistencies or logic errors while explaining.<br>

---

## Debugging Multi-Threaded Programs

Multithreading can cause race conditions when accessing shared resources.

### Fixes:
⚙ Use synchronization techniques like locks.<br>
⚙ Avoid modifying shared variables without protection.<br>
⚙ Debug using logging and controlled test cases.<br>

---

## Debugging with Breakpoints

Using breakpoints in an IDE helps inspect variable states.

### Fixes:
🛑 Pause execution at critical points to inspect values.<br>
🛑 Step through code execution line by line.<br>
🛑 Use debugging tools like a debugger to analyze issues interactively.<br>

## Memory Optimization and Performance Debugging

Improving memory efficiency helps optimize performance.

### Fixes:
🚀 Use generators to avoid excessive memory usage.<br>
🚀 Optimize loops and data structures for efficiency.<br>
🚀 Monitor performance bottlenecks with profiling tools.<br>

---

## Debugging None Returns

Ensuring functions return correct values is crucial.

### Fixes:
🔍 Check if the function is missing a return statement.<br>
🔍 Ensure return conditions cover all possible cases.<br>
🔍 Validate function outputs with test cases.<br>

---

## Handling Silent Failures

Errors should not be ignored without proper logging.

### Fixes:
📌 Always log errors instead of silently passing them.<br>
📌 Use meaningful error messages for better debugging.<br>
📌 Implement structured logging for easier analysis.<br>
