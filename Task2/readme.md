Debugging Python Code: Assignment Guide
This README summarizes essential debugging techniques in Python, covering common errors, exception handling, multithreading issues, performance optimizations, and more.

1. Error Classification
Errors in Python can be categorized into three types:

Syntax Errors: Issues with the structure of the code.
Runtime Errors: Errors that occur during execution, such as division by zero.
Logical Errors: The code runs but produces incorrect results.
Fixes:
Ensure correct syntax and structure, implement proper error handling, and test logic with sample inputs to detect incorrect outputs.

2. Debugging Complex Functions
Debugging functions involves handling incorrect inputs and ensuring the correct logic flow.

Fixes:
Validate inputs before processing.
Handle exceptions properly to prevent crashes.
Use logging to track errors and identify faulty values.
3. Handling Unreliable Functions
When dealing with unpredictable functions, exception handling ensures stability.

Fixes:
Use try-except blocks to catch potential errors.
Implement fallback values when the function fails.
Log failures to analyze patterns in unreliable behavior.
4. Writing Debug-Friendly Code
Refactoring improves readability and maintainability.

Fixes:
Use meaningful variable names.
Add comments to explain complex logic.
Follow consistent coding standards for better debugging.
5. Rubber Duck Debugging
Explaining your code out loud can help identify issues.

Steps:
Walk through the code step by step.
Ask yourself what each line does.
Identify inconsistencies or logic errors while explaining.
6. Debugging Multi-Threaded Programs
Multithreading can cause race conditions when accessing shared resources.

Fixes:
Use synchronization techniques like locks.
Avoid modifying shared variables without protection.
Debug using logging and controlled test cases.
7. Debugging with Breakpoints
Using breakpoints in an IDE helps inspect variable states.

Fixes:
Pause execution at critical points to inspect values.
Step through code execution line by line.
Use debugging tools like a debugger to analyze issues interactively.
8. Memory Optimization and Performance Debugging
Improving memory efficiency helps optimize performance.

Fixes:
Use generators to avoid excessive memory usage.
Optimize loops and data structures for efficiency.
Monitor performance bottlenecks with profiling tools.
9. Debugging None Returns
Ensuring functions return correct values is crucial.

Fixes:
Check if the function is missing a return statement.
Ensure return conditions cover all possible cases.
Validate function outputs with test cases.
10. Handling Silent Failures
Errors should not be ignored without proper logging.

Fixes:
Always log errors instead of silently passing them.
Use meaningful error messages for better debugging.
Implement structured logging for easier analysis.
Conclusion
This guide covered essential debugging techniques, including:

Understanding error classification and debugging methods.
Handling exceptions and writing debug-friendly code.
Fixing race conditions in multithreading.
Using breakpoints and optimizing memory usage.
