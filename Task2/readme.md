Debugging Python Code: Assignment Guide


1. Error Classification
Errors in Python can be categorized into three types:

Syntax Errors: Issues with the structure of the code.
Runtime Errors: Errors that occur during execution, such as division by zero.
Logical Errors: The code runs but produces incorrect results.
Fixes:
✅ Ensure correct syntax and structure.
✅ Implement proper error handling.
✅ Test logic with sample inputs to detect incorrect outputs.

2. Debugging Complex Functions
Debugging functions involves handling incorrect inputs and ensuring the correct logic flow.

Fixes:
✔️ Validate inputs before processing.
✔️ Handle exceptions properly to prevent crashes.
✔️ Use logging to track errors and identify faulty values.

3. Handling Unreliable Functions
When dealing with unpredictable functions, exception handling ensures stability.

Fixes:
🔹 Use try-except blocks to catch potential errors.
🔹 Implement fallback values when the function fails.
🔹 Log failures to analyze patterns in unreliable behavior.

4. Writing Debug-Friendly Code
Refactoring improves readability and maintainability.

Fixes:
🖊️ Use meaningful variable names.
🖊️ Add comments to explain complex logic.
🖊️ Follow consistent coding standards for better debugging.

5. Rubber Duck Debugging
Explaining your code out loud can help identify issues.

Steps:
🔎 Walk through the code step by step.
🔎 Ask yourself what each line does.
🔎 Identify inconsistencies or logic errors while explaining.

6. Debugging Multi-Threaded Programs
Multithreading can cause race conditions when accessing shared resources.

Fixes:
⚙️ Use synchronization techniques like locks.
⚙️ Avoid modifying shared variables without protection.
⚙️ Debug using logging and controlled test cases.

7. Debugging with Breakpoints
Using breakpoints in an IDE helps inspect variable states.

Fixes:
🛑 Pause execution at critical points to inspect values.
🛑 Step through code execution line by line.
🛑 Use debugging tools like a debugger to analyze issues interactively.

8. Memory Optimization and Performance Debugging
Improving memory efficiency helps optimize performance.

Fixes:
🚀 Use generators to avoid excessive memory usage.
🚀 Optimize loops and data structures for efficiency.
🚀 Monitor performance bottlenecks with profiling tools.

9. Debugging None Returns
Ensuring functions return correct values is crucial.

Fixes:
🔍 Check if the function is missing a return statement.
🔍 Ensure return conditions cover all possible cases.
🔍 Validate function outputs with test cases.

10. Handling Silent Failures
Errors should not be ignored without proper logging.

Fixes:
📌 Always log errors instead of silently passing them.
📌 Use meaningful error messages for better debugging.
📌 Implement structured logging for easier analysis.

📌 Conclusion
This guide covered essential debugging techniques, including:
✅ Understanding error classification and debugging methods.
✅ Handling exceptions and writing debug-friendly code.
✅ Fixing race conditions in multithreading.
✅ Using breakpoints and optimizing memory usage.
✅ Preventing silent failures and ensuring correct return values.
